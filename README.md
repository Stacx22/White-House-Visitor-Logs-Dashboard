# White House Visitor Logs Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes White House visitor logs to explore patterns in civic access, timing, and event frequency while maintaining privacy and ethical standards.

## Data
- Public visitor log data (e.g., WAVES or equivalent public dataset)
- Key fields: date/time, event type, visitor count, location

## Methods
- Language: Python or R
- Tools: dashboards (e.g., Plotly Dash, Power BI, or R Shiny)
- Analysis:
  - Time series of visit counts
  - Breakdown by event type or location
  - Peak times and repeat visit analysis

## Ethics
Focus is on aggregate patterns, not individual visitors. Identifying information should be anonymized or excluded.

## Repository Structure

- `data/` – description of where to download data
- `docs/` – screenshots and summary report
- `results/` – charts used in dashboard
